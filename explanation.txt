Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.
I am accessing the Tumblr API to gather the following data:
    - /following = The total number of blogs that I am following (n=12)
    - /tags = Up to 20 blogs related to a specific search term ("social justice")

Since Tumblr uses Oauth1, I have adapted the twitter code used in class to cache, time-limit, and store credentials related to accessing the Tumblr API.

For each blog, I will parse through JSON to access the blog name, title, description, URL, and associated tags, where available

I will write 2 CSV files, one for the blogs I'm following ("tumblr_blogs_followed.csv") and another for blogs related to a specific search term ("social_justice_blogs.csv"). Data in each CSV file:
  - "tumblr_blogs_followed.csv": 4 columns - blog name,title, description, URL
  - "social_justice_blogs.csv": 4 columns - blog name, type, URL, ID, related tags

Tumblr API URL: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2
